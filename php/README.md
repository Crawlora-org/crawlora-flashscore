# Crawlora Flashscore API client for PHP (`crawlora/flashscore`)

This PHP package calls Crawlora's hosted Flashscore API at `https://api.crawlora.net/api/v1`. It exposes 54 endpoints covering scores, match details, competitions, teams, players, odds, and news. It does not call or scrape Flashscore directly. Requests require a Crawlora API key and use your Crawlora account's service plan.

## Install

```sh
composer require crawlora/flashscore
```

Create an account at [crawlora.net](https://crawlora.net/signup?utm_source=packagist&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=platform-clients&utm_content=flashscore-php-signup), open the [Crawlora console](https://crawlora.net/app?utm_source=packagist&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=platform-clients&utm_content=flashscore-php-console) to get an API key, then set `CRAWLORA_API_KEY` in your environment.

```php
<?php
require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

$client = new Crawlora\Flashscore\Client(apiKey: getenv('CRAWLORA_API_KEY'));
$result = $client->request("flashscore-search", ['q' => 'football']);
print_r($result);
$client->close();
```

The client uses PHP cURL and JSON. Constructor options are `apiKey`, `baseUrl`, and `timeout`. Call the operation-specific method for direct access to each supported operation, or `request($operationId, $params, $responseType)` to dispatch by operation ID. Set `$responseType` to `text` for raw text output such as transcript formats. The package includes 54 API operations.
